# What I Did

* First I created the base for the HTML

* Then I added my elements with classes and ids

* Then I set up my CSS to create the page the way I wanted it to look

* After the I created my JS file and constructed the way the buttons and page would preform based upon right or wrong answers

* I then created an additional 2 HTML sheets to house my high scores page and my out of time page
